                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        My educational journey began at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I earned a Bachelor of Engineering, specializing in Structural Engineering. Here, I delved deep into advanced structural analysis and design methodologies, gaining proficiency in using industry-standard software for structural analysis and design. I further pursued a Master of Applied Science at the same institution, specializing in concrete materials. My master's research focused on the innovative field of oxidation testing for sulphide-bearing aggregates in concrete, leading to the development of novel methods and valuable insights.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond the world of codes, structures, and algorithms, I have a myriad of interests that shape who I am. Did you know that during my time at Toronto Metropolitan University, I contributed to extensive research on concrete materials? It's a testament to my belief that there's always something new to learn, even in traditional fields. In the realm of web development, while I've independently built platforms like 'Blogtopia', I've also cherished collaborative projects like 'Movie Review', where I worked with a team of five developers, navigating the challenges and joys of team dynamics.
